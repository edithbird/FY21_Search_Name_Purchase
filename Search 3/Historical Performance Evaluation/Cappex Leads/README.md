# Basic Description 

This project consists of an enrollment funnel for 
the Cappex leads 
purchased last July. This small project that needs to be completed prior 
to the upcoming search purchase. Because Cappex will continue to sell 
Lead Names (at a potential savings because they'll dedupe to our 
database) we need to determine if they actually out-performed other 
vendors.
